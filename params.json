{"name":"sacd-ripper","tagline":"The sacd-ripper homepage http://sacd-ripper.github.io/","body":"## Introduction\r\n\r\nSACD includes various copy protection measures of which the most prominent is Pit Signal Processing (PSP). The first two generations of Sony's Playstation 3 (PS3) game console are capable of reading SACD ScarletBook and bypass the copy protection.\r\n\r\nThis software makes use of the PS3 and gives you the option to backup your precious SACDs to a 1:1 decrypted ISO or you can choose to extract the individual tracks to DSDIFF (DFF) or DSF which allows you to create a [DSD disc](http://ps3sacd.com/dsddiscguide.html).\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\nI advise you to thoroughly read the [instructions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sacd-ripper/sacd-ripper/master/readme) before you get started. In short you will need a SACD [compatible](http://ps3sacd.com/faq.html#_Toc180147566) PS3, and last but not least it needs to have a firmware smaller or equal to 3.55 else you won't be able to run the software. And no, a downgrade for a firmware higher than 3.55 is NOT available.\r\n\r\nAfter weeks of testing (thank you Patrick!) and fixing bugs it's safe to say we've officially reached a stable version which makes SACD-Ripper version 0.21 our beta. From now on make sure you are running (version number should be displayed at startup) at least version 0.21 before reporting new bugs.\r\n\r\n## Donations\r\n\r\nAll coding & research is done in my spare time.
